Low latency is critical for a high frequency trading firm. Traders build complicated statistical models around the behaviour of market as reflected in ticker prices on exchanges, and execute their plan to buy or sell stocks accordingly. This is called devising a strategy. It is imperative that these strategies get triggered as early as possible to not only be profitable, but also to be ahead of competitive firms. \par
\emph{Refinitiv \texttrademark} is one such firm which publishes well known dataset known as Institutional Brokers' Estimate System or \emph{I/B/E/S}. This dataset contains earning estimates of different U.S.A. companies. Even though companies change their names in due course of business, such as when they get acquired, these estimates are not interrupted since they were first published in 1976. Refinitiv publishes this data both as end-of-the-day archived file, as well as a real-time feed. \par
Tower has a paid subscription to this data and provides it to those traders who have created a strategy around it. \par
While some traders depend on real time feed, other traders are happy with the archived data. Thus, our design should be able to cater to both kind of users.
